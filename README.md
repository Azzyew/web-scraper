# :paperclip: Introduction

This project was mainly for me to study both web scraping as well as Node.js with Mongoose, while doing something towards a goal that I set because it is lacking in the web: a Naruto API

# :computer: Technologies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Puppeteer](https://puppeteer.github.io/puppeteer/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)

# :rocket: How to run

### Walkthrough
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/azzyew/web-scraper.git

# Go to project folder
$ cd web-scraper

#Set an .env file as well as a URLs.json file in the project directory and run page.js and then index.js
```
